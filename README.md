# ZenBot
The ZenBot is a RLBot that stays in the goal, tries to save any shots you make, and then returns the ball to you. It can be used to practice your shots.

### How do I use it?

Oops! I didn't actually write it yet, but I'm working on it. Hold tight!

## Changing the bot

- Bot behavior is controlled by `python_example/python_example.py`
- Bot appearance is controlled by `python_example/appearance.cfg`

See https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample/wiki for documentation and tutorials.
